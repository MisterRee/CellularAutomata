				HEAT MAP CELL AUTOMATA, WITH MOUSE OVER EVENT COLORING
				A: Danny lee
				D: 2/6/2017

				This page fills the screen with grids which follows the celluar automata rules of the 'game of life.'
				However, instead of cells having a binary 'alive or dead' state, living cells merely darken its cell gradually, instead of instantly.
				The same goes for the opposite; 'dead' cells gradually lighten the cell color over time.

				The cells are only grayscale from black to white by the automata. Mousing over cells colors them to a randomly generated color.
				The colors left behind your mouse will decay into white, and may create new colors along the decay cycyle.

				Clicking rerolls your color. Mixing colors together can create some unpredictable effects with how the colors combine together.
